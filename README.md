## Description

_Pierre is running a sucessful bakery and his pastries and bread are flying off the shelf. However, he needs a way to keep track of all his clients and how much each one is purchasing in a given day. This application is setup like how a website Database might function. The user can enter clients into the system and then click on their name to add extra details about that client to be stored and revisited later_
